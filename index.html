          <h1>What Are Trees?</h1>
          <p>
            Trees are magnificent plants that play a vital role in our
            ecosystem. They are large, perennial woody plants with a single main
            trunk and branches extending outward. Trees provide numerous
            benefits to our environment and society. They not only absorb carbon
            dioxide and release oxygen, but they also help regulate temperature,
            conserve water, and prevent soil erosion. Trees offer shade, enhance
            biodiversity, and contribute to the overall beauty of our
            landscapes.

          <h1>Benefits:</h1>
          <p>
            Planting trees offers numerous benefits to the environment, society,
            and economy. Trees play a crucial role in air purification, carbon
            sequestration, and creating habitats for wildlife. They enhance the
            aesthetics of our surroundings and contribute to the overall
            well-being of communities. By planting trees, we can actively
            participate in climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation,
            and the improvement of our local ecosystems.

          <p>
            Proper tree planting is essential for ensuring the tree&'s
            successful establishment and long-term health. Follow these steps to
            plant a tree effectively:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Select an appropriate planting site with adequate space for the
              tree to grow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare the soil by loosening it and removing any weeds or grass.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dig a hole that is wider and slightly shallower than the tree's
              root ball.
            </li>
            <li>Place the tree in the hole, making sure it stands straight.</li>
            <li>
              Backfill the hole with soil, gently firming it around the roots.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water the tree thoroughly and add a layer of mulch around the base
              to conserve moisture and suppress weeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Regularly monitor the tree's growth and provide ongoing care as
              needed.
